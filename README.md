### üß¨ Micro-optimized reactivity engine
Sekoia is powered by an advanced reactivity engine that enhances serializable data with first-class observability, time travel, shape and type consistency and insanely optimized state diffing.

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Data driven custom elements
Sekoia gives your UI code structure by making native customElements reactive and composable while facilitating architecturally clean access to the DOM.

### Router
Pretty advanced hash-based router for SPAs with reactive route actions and
route filtering for conditional re-routes. I don't have time to document it rn.

### Server
Simple REST API helper with request buffering and indexedDB caching plus cache expiration.
Nothing too fancy.

### Utils
Common functions that are shared by internal modules and are also useful for implementation
code of high-performance web apps.
